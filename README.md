We have used amazing technologies in this project. Zenject is one of the best dependency injection tool we used, it just made the development very easy with all the good things of MVC design pattern, state machine and more. For the movement of Player, Enemies and Camera iTween is used, again super easy to use and gave cool look to game in minutes.

Some of the good tech stuff -

Design Patterns:
* MVC design pattern
* Highly de-coupled code through the use of interfaces at different levels of abstraction
* State Machine
* Observer Pattern
* Factory Pattern

Principles Used:
* Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Tools Used:
* Zenject (Dependency Injection) https://github.com/modesttree/Zenject
* Async-await (so much better than Coroutines :P)
* iTween
